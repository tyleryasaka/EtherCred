# EtherCred
An online credibility network built on [ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/).

EtherCred is a concept for a platform to establish credibility online. The idea is to let users specify what other users they trust, and then to make this information publicly available as a graph/network. Various algorithms can then be used on this graph to determine how credible user Z is to user A, based on how A and Z are connected on this graph. It is being built on ethereum to ensure complete transparency - no private servers will be involved.

The concept is not especially brilliant and certainly not original. In fact it’s intended to copy the way people establish credibility in real life. However, at the moment, the way credibility is established online is arguably not very... credible. Each app or website implements its own method of establishing credibility. Some are better than others, and some might even be quite good. However, it seems that a few problems remain:


* For the most part, credibility is not bridged across these applications. You might have 3,000 friends on Facebook and several hundred Instagram followers, but it is difficult to associate any of them with an Amazon user or a Yelp reviewer. You might have 50,295 Twitter followers, but on on RateMyProfessor you’re just another disgruntled student.
* An application determines the credibility of a user, and this one rating or approval is shared displayed to all users in the system. This may seem perfectly normal until it is compared with the real world, where a person’s credibility can often be quite subjective (depending on who you associate with and trust). If you associate with one group of people, you might find Jane Doe to be an honest and fair person. However, the people on the other side of town may have perhaps seen Jane on a worse day and may not think as well of her.
* Due to anonymity of the internet, it is very difficult to verify the identify of online users without requesting some form of official documentation. Thus, on many websites it is fairly trivial to create a fake account and become an anonymous troll.
* An enormous amount of trust is placed on the owners of an app to maintain a credibility system. The actual systems that manage credibility run behind closed doors. Ideally, we do not want corporations telling us who we should trust.


EtherCred does not (yet) suggest that it can solve all or even any of these problems on its own. Its purpose is (1) to promote discussion and thought around this idea and (2)  to begin making progress towards a solution. Maybe it will work, probably it won’t.


In any case, it’ll be fun. :sunglasses:
